# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Project
**SmartCare ICU – AI-Powered ICU Management and Clinical Decision Support System**

---

# 1. SDLC Model

SmartCare ICU follows the **Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. The project is developed iteratively, allowing continuous improvement, regular feedback, and gradual integration of AI features.

Reasons for choosing Agile:

- Supports incremental development
- Easy to adapt to changing requirements
- Frequent testing and feedback
- Suitable for AI feature integration
- Faster delivery of a working MVP
